# Score-Prediction-data-analysis-and-visualization
The primary objective of this project is to leverage supervised learning techniques to predict students' final grades in an online machine learning course. 
The dataset includes comprehensive information such as exam scores, quiz results, peer reviews, and course diaries from 107 students enrolled in the course. The ultimate goal is to assist instructors in identifying struggling students early on and providing them with the necessary support to enhance their learning outcomes.

**Features**

Supervised Learning: Utilizes the power of machine learning to predict student performance.
Data Analysis: Examines grades, participation, and other course activities as key indicators of success.
Model Selection: Implements Random Forest Classifier and Gaussian Naïve Bayes models from sci-kit-learn for prediction.

**Tools Used**

Python
Scikit-learn
Jupyter Notebooks
Pandas
Matplotlib
Random Forest Classifier
Gaussian Naïve Bayes

**Project Goal**

The project aims to empower educators by providing a tool to recognize students who may be struggling or at risk of dropping out. By analyzing grades and participation data, machine learning models can identify patterns indicative of low performance. This enables timely intervention, allowing instructors to offer targeted support and guidance to improve student outcomes and reduce dropout rates.
